	</ul>
	<dl>
		<dt></dt>
		<dd>There will be some spot that motorcycle can't notice and just ride through it which is blindspot but it was really dangerous when you don't even stop and slowly ride through it. Moreover,this is the reason why accident always happen and this is why the road sign is important cause you must stop when there are road sign to told you stop.

	<ul>
		<li><h2>Check Your Side Mirror Before You Start Moving.</h2></li>
	</ul>
	<dl>
		<dt></dt>
		<dd>It is important to check your side mirror before you ride out from your car garage. This is because side mirror will help you a lot when you try to cut into other lane because it can help to notice whether there are car coming from right or left easily and you don't need to turn your body to the back to just to check whether there are other motorcyclist cut into the same lane that you wish to ride.</dd>

	<ul>
		<li><h2>Brake Functioning Properly.</h2></li>
	</ul>
	<dl>
		<dt></dt>
		<dd>Brake not only is one of the important part of a motorcycle, but also it will save your life in every situation. However, riders should use it properly because it can be dangerous when you use it in a wrong way.  For instance, riders should slowly put down their legs to the ground to balance their body because motorcycle is way more heavier than we think it should be. So, riders should check their brake before start riding on the road or even on the parking spot, and not only ensure the brake is functioning, but also function properly to avoid any unfortunate accident happens anymore.</dd>
